        Obtained the help from Elgin to realize that bolded text should not formally be represented by the <strong> tag inside the HTML page, but rather by a <span> class inside the CSS page.
        Apparently, because bolded text is a type of style, it should be accomodated in the CSS file, not the HTML file.

      The music in our world, just like the world itself, is ever-constantly changing. As we are living in this decade of the 2010s, we are noticing that our music evolves not just by experimenting with various technological and artificial sounds provided by electronic instruments but by also exploring other musical genres and waves to create a fusion of new beats, rhythms, and tones that we have always wanted to hear. <span class="bolded_text">This year, this idea of music fusion is becoming stronger and more evident in the genres of R&B, jazz, and soul.</span>

    <p>
      These are some of the intelligent, inspiring, and beautifully-sounding R&B artists who I discovered growing in their music tastes and demonstrating their soulful vibes.

            to say he's not one of this decade's most notable R&B artists? Boy, do I love him! An American singer, songwriter, drummer, and record producer from Oxnard, California, he creates jumpy and dancy music by following the never-ending process of experimenting with instruments he is comfortable and not comfortable at. Having made his 5 complete albums, he has grown to incorporate his lyrics and tunes with his story of being arrested, homeless, and never-ending love for his family and friends.

            I just discovered Christopher Gallant last week, and man did his music strike right into my heart and soul! I was surprised to see how grateful he was to brought up in such a supportive family and prestiguous school. Having started his music career in 2013 in Los Angeles, he constantly collaborates with Jhene Aiko and other like-minded artists to fill the ears of those listening to him with enriching, novel, and soulful music - especially that of his debut studio album,

            Mah boi, Tom Misch. I discovered this amazing artist through his song, 
            <a href="https://youtu.be/5CO0iiOMz3I" target="_blank">
              So Close</a>, 
            and I was instantly hooked with his music. His lyrics describe a release from reality and looks at the value of dreams, aspirations, and happiness. Using his formula to incorporate the melancholy of his synth instruments with the upbeat rhythms of the electric guitar and the drums, I can sense how comforting and transparent he puts his hopeful personality into his work. Mind you, he's just starting his music career - he's just 21 years old! Fortunately, the aesthetics of his music is emphasized in his live performances.
